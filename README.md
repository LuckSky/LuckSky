- 👀 I am interested in everything related to AI, BigData, DeepLearning, MachineLearning, I studied industrial electronics, therefore automata are also of interest to me, together with my work team at school, I made my first robot arm controlled by the parallel port of the PC, controlling stepper motors that we extracted from printers and CD readers, it was programmed in C++ and we included microcontroller programming (Microchip's PIC-16f86) using low-level assembly language, the arm had 3 degrees of freedom, although originally there were four, but the last degree was not worth it, the degrees were; Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist and the last invalid, fingers.
I had my first computer when I was 15 years old (1985), a Timex Sinclair from the TIMEX watch brand and that was beginning to venture into computer technology, later I had a Commodore Vic-20 and then a brand new Commodore 64 in which I programmed in Basic and At that time handling the new Sprites, I read magazines like MICOMPUTER and CommodoreWorld, I had my first motherboard with an Intel 2nd generation microprocessor, that is, 8088, mine was an 8086 microprocessor and included its mathematical co-processor the 8087, I studied its 8-bit assembler bits and I learned programming languages ​​with Basic, COBOL, RPG, Fortran 77 along with its reverse Polish notation, then I learned Pascal and its novel management of nodes in ram memory for ordering items with the binary tree method, then, several years later I met Linux, the version of Mr. Potato Head...
